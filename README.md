## How Lockdown Affected Attention Towards Video Games

The goal of this project is to analyze how various genres of video games were affected differently and to study the correlation between different video game genres and the severity of lockdown during COVID-19. This will be achieved by analyzing the language used in different Wikipedia pages for each game, as well as examining mobility data in each country to estimate the severity of lockdown.

Research Questions:
- Is there a consistent trend for the same genres of video games during the COVID-19 pandemic?
  - Investigate whether certain video game genres experienced similar patterns of popularity or decline during the pandemic.
  - Explore potential factors influencing these trends, such as changes in user preferences, gaming habits, or social dynamics.

- What is the relationship between mobility patterns and the traffic of video game Wikipedia pages?
  - Examine how variations in mobility data, reflecting the severity of lockdown measures, correspond to changes in the viewership of video game Wikipedia pages.
  - Analyze whether increased or decreased mobility aligns with heightened interest in specific video game genres, indicating a potential connection between real-world restrictions and virtual entertainment.

- To what extent can English Wikipedia pages serve as a reliable estimate of the average effect on video game popularity during the pandemic?
  - Assess the generalizability of findings from English Wikipedia pages to global trends, considering cultural and linguistic differences.
  - Explore whether language-specific Wikipedia pages provide consistent insights into the popularity or decline of video game genres, or if there are notable variations that need to be considered in the analysis.





Compare games that are representative with the lockdown severity by looking at mobilities.
A few similar games and look if they have the same trend with each other and with lockdown intensity
Use english ones as a sort of average

Extra dataset are the ones of the games if not included in the original
